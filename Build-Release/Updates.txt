4.0.0 - b4001
——————————————
- Fix: Diary database, the previous diary.db file will now have messed up entries in it if you edited the diary with b4000.
	Either delete the file before starting MX, or re-copy your existing one from MV v3.
	(The cause was SQLite library reversing the default value of a optional switch about date storage)
- Fix: Backups now name the backed up day file dayfile2.txt rather than dayfile.txt
- Fix: NOAA Monthly report was broken reading the log file

- Fix/New: The install as a service should now work again for Windows. It *may" now also work on Linux!


- New: Now encrypts user credentials in the cumulus.ini file
	- This isn't meant to be a terribly secure solution, it is prevent users posting a cumulus.ini file that contains plaintext creds as diagnostics on the forum.
	- A UniqueId.txt file is created in the main CumulusMX folder, this contains the decrypt key for the credentials. Anyone with access to this file can decrypt
		the credentials in cumulus.ini


- Changed: Exception logging is now standardised and much more verbose. Hopefully it will provide more meaningful diagnostics for failures
- Changed: Internal changes, lots more code now running asynchronously including SQLite, some structural changes



4.0.0 - b4000
——————————————

- Installing .Net 5 on Windows (if not already installed)
	- Go to the download page https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet
	- Download the .NET 5.0 Runtime package for Windows (x64 most likely!)
	- Run the downloaded file



- Installing .Net 5 on Raspberry Pi - This assumes you are running Debian/Raspbian 11
	- A utility to check how many bits your processor uses...
		sudo apt update
		sudo apt install lshw
		sudo lshw | grep width
	- Check the output, is the "width" 64 or 32 bits? You will need to know this for the install

	See this web page for Microsoft's instructions https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/linux-debian

	- Install the Runtime on 64 bit Pi's (Pi 4 only)
		- Before you install .NET, run the following commands to add the Microsoft package signing key to your list of trusted keys and add the package repository.
			wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/debian/11/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
			sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
			rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb
		- Now do the install
			sudo apt-get update; \
			  sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https && \
			  sudo apt-get update && \
			  sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-runtime-5.0

	- Install the Runtime on 32 bit Pi's (everything other than the Pi 4)
		wget https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh
		chmod +x dotnet-install.sh
		sudo ./dotnet-install.sh -c Current --install-dir /usr/share/dotnet --runtime dotnet
		sudo echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/share/dotnet' > /etc/profile.d/dotnet.sh
		sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/dotnet.sh
		export PATH=$PATH:/usr/share/dotnet

	- Test the run time
		dotnet --info

	- Copy the contents of the distribution zip file to /opt/CumulusMX



- Running Cumulus MX 4 on Windows
	cd /CumulusMX
	CumulusMX.exe

- Running Cumulus MX 4 on Linux
	cd /opt/CumulusMX
	dotnet CumulusMX.dll
